# Unity Physics Demo
This project is a small physics demo made in Unity, showcasing a few varying physics concepts that Unity supports.
The code in here is terrible, please don't use it for anything. I've written *much* better code elsewhere.

## Controls:
WASD - movement
Space - jump
Left mouse - apply a force to the object that the player is looking at
